# 🔐 Encryption Algorithms Project (Playfair & RSA)

This project is a **WinForms C# application** that demonstrates two classic encryption algorithms: **Playfair** and **RSA**.✨

---

## 🧩 Features

### 🔡 Playfair Cipher
- Open an existing file and save the encrypted/decrypted file.  
- Choose **5x5** or **6x6** matrix for encryption. 

### 🔑 RSA Algorithm
- Open an existing file and save the encrypted/decrypted file.  
- Supports **Vietnamese text encryption**.
