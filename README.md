## 🧩 Features

### 🔡 Playfair Cipher
- Open an existing file and save the encrypted/decrypted file.  
- Choose **5x5** or **6x6** matrix for encryption.  
- Easy-to-use interface for both encryption and decryption.  

### 🔑 RSA Algorithm
- Open an existing file and save the encrypted/decrypted file.  
- Supports **Vietnamese text encryption**.  
- Simple key management for demonstration purposes.
